The CSS rule `:focus-visible` is not supported in older browsers.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or no styling at all for focused elements in those browsers.  For example, consider the following code:

```css
a:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

In modern browsers, only elements that truly need visual focus indicators (i.e., not those focused programmatically) will get the blue outline. However, older browsers lack this functionality, making the styling unpredictable.
