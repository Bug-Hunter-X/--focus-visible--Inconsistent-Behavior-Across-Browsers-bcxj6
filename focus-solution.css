To address the browser compatibility issue with `:focus-visible`, use feature detection and provide fallback styles.  One approach is to use a JavaScript polyfill or leverage a CSS-only solution. Here is the CSS-only approach:

```css
/* Fallback styles for older browsers */
a:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}

/* Modern browsers will prioritize :focus-visible */
a:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

This ensures that all browsers style focused elements, while modern browsers use the more refined `:focus-visible` behavior.
